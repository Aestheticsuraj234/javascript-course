1. **Generate a random number**: Use `Math.random()` to generate a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Multiply this by 100 to get a number between 0 and 100. Use `Math.floor()` to round this number down to the nearest integer, which will give you a random number between 0 and 99. Add 1 to this result to ensure the random number is between 1 and 100. Store this random number in a variable named `randomNumber`.

   ```javascript
   const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
   ```

2. **Get the form element**: Use `document.getElementById()` to get the form element with the id `'guessForm'`. Store this element in a variable named `guessForm`.

   ```javascript
   const guessForm = document.getElementById('guessForm');
   ```

3. **Add an event listener to the form**: Use the `addEventListener()` method on `guessForm` to listen for the `'submit'` event. Pass a callback function to handle the event.

   ```javascript
   guessForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
       // Event handling code goes here
   });
   ```

4. **Prevent default form submission behavior**: Inside the event handler function, use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form submission behavior, which would cause the page to reload.

   ```javascript
   event.preventDefault();
   ```

5. **Get the user's guess**: Use `document.getElementById()` to get the input element with the id `'guess'`. Retrieve the value of this input element, which represents the user's guess. Parse this value as an integer using `parseInt()` and store it in a variable named `userGuess`.

   ```javascript
   const userGuess = parseInt(document.getElementById('guess').value);
   ```

6. **Compare the user's guess with the random number**: Use an `if` statement to compare `userGuess` with `randomNumber`.

   ```javascript
   if (userGuess === randomNumber) {
       // If the guess matches the random number, display a congratulatory message
       alert('Congratulations! You win!');
   } else {
       // If the guess does not match the random number, display a message indicating the correct number
       alert(`Sorry, you lose! The correct number was ${randomNumber}.`);
   }
   ```

7. **Reload the application**: After displaying the result to the user, use `window.location.reload()` to reload the application, allowing the user to play again.

   ```javascript
   window.location.reload();
   ```

That's it! This JavaScript code generates a random number, listens for form submissions, compares the user's guess with the random number, displays a message based on the result, and reloads the application for another round of guessing.
