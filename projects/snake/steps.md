**Building a Snake Game with JavaScript: Code Walkthrough**

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the JavaScript code behind a classic Snake game. By dissecting each line of code, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how the game works and how you can customize it to your liking. Let's dive in!

**1. Setting Up the Game Board:**

```javascript
// Define HTML elements
const board = document.getElementById('game-board');
const instructionText = document.getElementById('instruction-text');
const logo = document.getElementById('logo');
const score = document.getElementById('score');
const highScoreText = document.getElementById('highScore');
```

These lines of code retrieve references to various HTML elements using `document.getElementById()`. These elements include the game board, instruction text, logo, score display, and high score display.

**2. Defining Game Variables:**

```javascript
// Define game variables
const gridSize = 20;
let snake = [{ x: 10, y: 10 }];
let food = generateFood();
let highScore = 0;
let direction = 'right';
let gameInterval;
let gameSpeedDelay = 200;
let gameStarted = false;
```

Here, we define several variables crucial for the game's functionality:

- `gridSize`: Determines the size of the game board grid (20 x 20 squares).
- `snake`: An array representing the snake's body, starting with a single segment at position {x: 10, y: 10}.
- `food`: Stores the current position of the food, initially generated using the `generateFood()` function.
- `highScore`: Tracks the highest score achieved in the game.
- `direction`: Stores the current direction of the snake (initially set to 'right').
- `gameInterval`: Holds the ID of the setInterval used for the game loop.
- `gameSpeedDelay`: Determines the speed of the game in milliseconds (initially set to 200).
- `gameStarted`: A boolean flag indicating whether the game is currently running.

**3. Drawing Functions:**

```javascript
// Draw game map, snake, food
function draw() {
  board.innerHTML = '';
  drawSnake();
  drawFood();
  updateScore();
}

// Draw snake
function drawSnake() {
  snake.forEach((segment) => {
    const snakeElement = createGameElement('div', 'snake');
    setPosition(snakeElement, segment);
    board.appendChild(snakeElement);
  });
}

// Create a snake or food cube/div
function createGameElement(tag, className) {
  const element = document.createElement(tag);
  element.className = className;
  return element;
}

// Set the position of snake or food
function setPosition(element, position) {
  element.style.gridColumn = position.x;
  element.style.gridRow = position.y;
}

// Draw food function
function drawFood() {
  if (gameStarted) {
    const foodElement = createGameElement('div', 'food');
    setPosition(foodElement, food);
    board.appendChild(foodElement);
  }
}
```

These functions handle drawing the game elements on the board:

- `draw()`: Clears the board, draws the snake, draws the food, and updates the score.
- `drawSnake()`: Iterates through the snake segments, creates a div element for each segment, assigns the 'snake' class, positions it on the board, and appends it to the board.
- `createGameElement()`: Utility function to create HTML elements with specified tags and class names.
- `setPosition()`: Sets the grid position of a game element based on its coordinates.
- `drawFood()`: Draws the food on the board if the game has started.

**4. Generating Food:**

```javascript
// Generate food
function generateFood() {
  const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize) + 1;
  const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * gridSize) + 1;
  return { x, y };
}
```

The `generateFood()` function creates random coordinates (x, y) within the game grid. It uses `Math.random()` to generate values between 0 and 1, scales them to the grid size, and adds 1 to ensure the food appears within the grid boundaries. It then returns an object with the x and y coordinates of the food position.

**5. Moving the Snake:**

```javascript
// Moving the snake
function move() {
  const head = { ...snake[0] };
  switch (direction) {
    case 'up':
      head.y--;
      break;
    case 'down':
      head.y++;
      break;
    case 'left':
      head.x--;
      break;
    case 'right':
      head.x++;
      break;
  }

  snake.unshift(head);

  if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
    food = generateFood();
    increaseSpeed();
    clearInterval(gameInterval); // Clear past interval
    gameInterval = setInterval(() => {
      move();
      checkCollision();
      draw();
    }, gameSpeedDelay);
  } else {
    snake.pop();
  }
}
```

The `move()` function updates the snake's position based on the current direction. It creates a new head position based on the current direction, adds it to the front of the snake array, and removes the last segment. If the snake eats the food (reaches the same position as the food), it generates a new food position, increases the game speed, and sets up a new game interval with the updated speed.

**Conclusion:**

This detailed walkthrough has provided insight into the JavaScript code behind a classic Snake game. By understanding each line of code and its purpose, you're better equipped to customize and enhance the game according to your preferences. Feel free to experiment with additional features, graphics, and gameplay mechanics to create your version of the classic game!
